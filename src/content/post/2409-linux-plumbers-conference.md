**Hello CachyOS Enthusiasts**,

We are pretty excited to announce, that CachyOS will be on this year's Linux Plumbers Conference in Vienna.
We will have a talk about the integration of sched-ext into CachyOS and about the process as well as the problems we faced and the solution we have found.

The general content will be:
- Short introduction about the CachyOS project and the persons
- Integration with systemd
- Improvements of sched-ext for the community (LAVD/bpfland)
- scx_loader - scheduler manager via dbus
