Greetings, CachyOS enthusiasts!

We're thrilled to announce the release of CachyOS, marking our 11th release in 2023. This update brings significant improvements to graphics performance and package updates, ensuring a smoother and more efficient experience for our users.

**NVIDIA Module Overhaul**

One of the key highlights of this release is the transition from using nvidia-dkms to precompiled NVIDIA modules. This change streamlines the update process and provides a consistent NVIDIA experience across all our kernel variants, including linux-zen and linux-hardened.

**Package Updates**

CachyOS 6.6.1 brings a range of package updates, including:

- linux-cachyos 6.6.1
- nvidia-utils 545.29.02
- mesa 23.2.1
- zfs-utils 2.2.0
- mkinitcpio 37

These updates provide enhanced stability, performance, and security for your CachyOS system.

**Bug Fixes**

We've also addressed several notable bugs, including:

- Reintegration of nvidia-hook to prevent installation issues with the new module
- Renaming of packages in the netinstall due to recent KF5 packaging changes
- Inclusion of xdg-desktop-portal-gnome in the GNOME installation for netinstall
